# 20 Minute PWA Built In Gatsby
This is a tiny bit different from the one in the tutorial:
* `gatsby-config.js` is configured for a root directory rather than a subdirectory

If you make changes you will need to "build" the final Gatsby code. 
To do this go to [the console](https://glitch.com/faq#console) and type `gatsby build`
